            <p class="info">The capybara is the largest rodent in the world. She has swimming membranes, thanks to which she swims and dives superbly. Capybaras live near bodies of water, live in large groups and feed on vegetation. They play an important role in the ecosystem, helping to disperse plant seeds and serving as a food source for predators.</p>
