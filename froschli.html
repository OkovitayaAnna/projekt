            <p class="info">Frogs are known for their croaking and musical abilities. Each species of frog has its own unique voice, and they use it to attract a mate during breeding. In addition, some types of frogs can make sounds that resemble other animals or environmental sounds.</p>
            <p class="info">Frogs have a variety of colors and body shapes. They can be green, brown, yellow, or even brightly colored. This diversity helps them to camouflage themselves and protect themselves from predators. Some species of frogs have bright colors that signal their poisonousness.</p>
            <p class="info">Frogs are amphibious, which means they can live both on land and in water. They have the ability to jump from great heights and far thanks to their strong hind legs. Frogs also have a sticky tongue that helps them catch their prey, which consists of insects and other small animals.</p>
            <p class="info">Frogs go through a complex process of metamorphosis, beginning their lives as tadpoles and evolving into adult frogs. They lay eggs in the water, from which tadpoles hatch, then they undergo changes in their physiology and turn into adults.</p>
            <p class="info">Frogs are important members of the ecosystem. They control insects that can be harmful to agriculture and are a food source for other predators. In addition, some types of frogs are of medical importance because their skin contains substances that can be used in medicines.</p>
            <p class="info">Overall, frogs are amazing creatures that come in a variety of shapes, colors, and behaviors. Their croaking, metamorphosis and adaptability make them interesting to study and observe in nature.</p>
