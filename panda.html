            <p class="info">Red pandas, also known as fire pandas, are small mammals that live in the mountainous regions of South and East Asia. Their most characteristic feature is their bright red fur and fluffy tail, which serves as a means of balance and protection from the cold.</p>
            <p class="info">Red pandas are predominantly arboreal and live in dense forests in trees. They have excellent agility and the ability to move from branch to branch. This helps them avoid predators and find food, which are bamboo shoots, leaves, fruits and young shoots.</p>
            <p class="info">Red pandas have a sweet tooth and prefer to eat bamboo. They may consume large amounts of bamboo throughout the day, and their diet may also include fruits, berries, eggs, insects, and small rodents. These cute creatures spend most of their time looking for and eating food.</p>
            <p class="info">Red pandas are solitary animals and do not usually form stable pairs. They prefer to lead a hidden nocturnal lifestyle, becoming active at dusk and at night. They can be quite shy and wary, so watching them in the wild can be a challenge.</p>
            <p class="info">The conservation of red pandas is important as their numbers are declining due to habitat loss and illegal hunting. Many organizations and zoos are involved in the red panda breeding and conservation program in order to maintain their population and protect their habitat.</p>
            <p class="info">Red pandas are admired for their unique beauty and playful nature. The study and conservation of these wonderful creatures helps us to better understand and appreciate the richness of nature and the need to preserve it for future generations.</p>
